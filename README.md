# CSE-163-Final-Project

Structure:
This project is structured in an organized way so that it is easy to interact with. Under the datasets folder is where the 14 csv files used for this project is located. Under the expected folder houses the png pictures that the code is expected to output. These are for testing purposes. Under the plots folder is where a majority of the png files are housed. This is every single plot that is outputted by the code. Under the test_datasets folder is where the sample datasets for testing purposes are located. Under no particular folder are the three main files question0.py, question1.py, and question2.py. The entirety of the code for this project is located within these files. If you wish to run these files seperately, in the Visual Studio Code terminal, type: python3 question0.py

Cloning:
